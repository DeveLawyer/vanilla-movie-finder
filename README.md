Easy application for film search following a [Florin Pop tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4&t=20344s). Built in JS vanilla with the intention of, later, making it in React and comparing the processes. I was able to practice basic HTML, CSS and JS skills, as well as consume an API.
